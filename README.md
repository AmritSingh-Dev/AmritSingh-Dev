## About Me
Hello! I'm a **UK-based Software Developer**, my journey into coding began during my BSc in Music Technology, where I was introduced to coding through the visual language **Max MSP**. Since then, I've developed an interest in software development, which inspired my career transition into tech. I'm currently pursuing an MSc in Computer Science at **MMU**, focusing on enterprise programming, database systems, and UX design.

I'm actively seeking a front-end web development role/placement, with a focus on working with Java or JavaScript. I would love the opportunity to work closely with a small team and contribute meaningfully from the start. If you're hiring, I would love to hear from you!

## Tech Stack
  Proficient in **Java**, **Python**, **JavaScript**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **MySQL**, and **SQLite**.  
  Comfortable using **Visual Studio Code** for front-end development and **Eclipse** for Java.
  
Thanks for stopping by! Let's build something amazing together. ðŸš€
